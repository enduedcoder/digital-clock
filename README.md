# Digital Clock (React + Vite)

Minimal React app (TypeScript) created to run with pnpm + Vite.

How to run

1. Open a shell in this folder:

   cd digital-clock

2. Install dependencies:

   pnpm install

3. Start dev server:

   pnpm dev

Notes

- This project uses Vite + React (JS). If you want TypeScript, I can convert it and add tsconfig + types.
- This project uses Vite + React with TypeScript (files are .tsx). If you prefer JavaScript instead, I can revert.
- The dev server runs on a local port (Vite default). If you want me to run it now and keep it running in the background, tell me and I'll start it.
